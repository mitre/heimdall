# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.ruby-gemset

# Ignore Mac DS_Store files
**/.DS_Store

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

.kitchen/

# Hide docker secrets file from repository
.env-prod

# Terraform files and folders
terraform/terraform.tfstate
terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup
terraform/.terraform
